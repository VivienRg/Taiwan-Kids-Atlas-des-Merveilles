[{"name":"National Museum of Natural Science - Ancient Stories Told by Ancient People","desc":"Want to learn about the prehistoric Eight Immortals Cave on the east coast, the Neolithic cultures of Beinan and Kirin, as well as the Central Taiwan Dabaokeng, Nioumatou, Dama Lin, Yingpu, and Fanziyuan cultures? The museum has updated its permanent exhibition area and launched 'Ancient Stories Told by Ancient People'. The exhibition is vivid and presented in animated video clips and multimedia interactive ways. In addition to understanding what archaeology written in history textbooks is, you can also experience the ancient Taiwanese way of life firsthand. The central region is currently one of the focuses of archaeological research in Taiwan. Over the past twenty years, archaeologists have achieved fruitful excavation results in various places. Therefore, based on the latest archaeological excavation data, the museum has decided to update the permanent exhibition area. In addition to displaying the rice planted at the Taichung Anhe site, the youth wearing a shark tooth jade ornament, and the complete iron knife unearthed at the Nantun Mountain Zaijiao site, there is also a deer horn with artificial saw marks from the Penghu Trench provided by Mr. Tsai Kunyu, a folk collector. Combined with the research of Dr. Zhang Junxiang, a Penghu native, it proves that hunters were in Taiwan 190,000 to 450,000 years ago.

The exhibition area is planned with 5 major themes, jointly planned by nearly 20 researchers from the museum, presenting the rules and mysteries of the natural world in a simple and clear manner. Stepping into the exhibition hall, the first thing that catches the eye is a giant over 400-year-old Taiwan cedar specimen. Visitors can experience its smell and texture in the experience area. There is also a nearly 4-meter-long, manually operated mechanical squid that is eye-catching and cool. 'Fantastic Nature' permanent exhibition area is located on the basement 1st floor of the Life Science Hall, covering an area of 253 pings. It took more than 3 years of communication and deliberation among 20 co-curators, the well-known Yujian Design Company, and its cooperative team to transform its predecessor 'Numbers and Shapes'. 'Fantastic Nature' includes 5 units: 'Wow Nature! Hi Science', 'Round Not Round: Egg Science', 'Move: Biomechanics', 'Chase: Calculation and Behavior', 'Tell Stories: Explore Nature, Discover Science', intricately introducing the diversity, forms, functions, behaviors, and scientific exploration of the natural world. Visitors can explore a variety of scientific stories. Museum permanent exhibitions generally last 10 to 20 years. Thanks to technology, the academic world may 'discover new species' or 'establish new theories' every few years. Therefore, the display cases are specially designed as 'front-opening', making it easy to update exhibits or specimens in line with academic discoveries and interact with the audience according to lecture or tour needs.","subtitle":"Exhibition at the National Museum of Natural Science","source":{"name":"National Museum of Natural Science"},"shows":[{"city":"Taichung","district":"North

The exhibition showcases over 30 works by Amis artist Siki Sufin, including wood carvings and videos, as well as the artist's creative process and timeline over more than 30 years. Siki Sufin, an Amis artist, returned to the Dulan tribe around the age of 25 and has been engaged in art creation for 30 years, mainly focusing on the culture and stories of the tribe. The artist's creations include three-dimensional and flat works carved from driftwood, as well as performances of body art, traditional songs, and documentary filming, all aimed at exploring and deeply excavating the life stories of the tribe to create a new perspective on indigenous peoples. The curator, Yidan Bawawalon, stated that the exhibition, themed 'The Long Road is Still Long', explores the artist's creative process through wood carvings, dances, videos, and how the artist inherits tribal culture through interdisciplinary creation, raising self-reflective questions. The exhibition also delves into the artist's creative thinking by connecting personal creative contexts, exploring how the artist uses driftwood as a medium to express traditional culture and values, as well as the symbolic meanings of extended imagery, summarizing the artist's creative perspective, spirit, methods, and central concepts.","subtitle":"Exhibition at the Indigenous Peoples Cultural Development Center","source":{"name":"Yidan Creative Vision"},"shows":[{"city":"Pingtung County","district":"Majia Township","venue_name":"Eight-Angle Tower Special Exhibition Hall, Indigenous Peoples Cultural Park","price_text":"","address_en":"No. 104, Fengjing, Beiyeh Village, Majia Township, Pingtung County 90341","time":"2025-06-14T09:00:00","end_time":"2025-08-31T17:00:00"}],"imageUrl":"https://cloud.culture.tw/e_new_upload/cms/image/A0/B0/C0/D18/E162/F516/3af541a7-464a-4563-b8ad-610b1f2df3b0.jpg","categories":["Art","Culture","Learning"],"tags":["Creative","Nature","Tour"]},{"name":"補天- 陳廷彰個展","desc":"The exhibition '補天 Series' continues to reflect on myths and observations in life, intertwining the cosmic view of unity and duality in myths with everyday observations.

Chen Tingzhang's works often use sparse lines to outline images, leaving space unfilled, creating a sense of subjectivity in space.
